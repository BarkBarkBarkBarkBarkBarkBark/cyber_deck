              Why we started
            </h2>
            <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The cyberdeck concept has existed in the hardware community for
              years. Hundreds of hobbyists have built beautiful one-offs. But
              nothing purpose-built for working professionals existed at a
              consistent, reliable level.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The gap wasn't technical. It was intent. Most kits are designed
              for experimentation, not deployment. For tinkering, not work.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-400 leading-relaxed">
              We set out to fill that gap — building professional-grade portable
              computing systems with the same attention to configuration,
              reliability, and documentation that enterprise hardware gets. Just
              smaller, lighter, and designed for the job.
